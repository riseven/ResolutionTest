# ResolutionTest

*An Action Script reverse AI game*

This is a simple game done in ActionScript where the player needs to find 
some features in a low resolution image. As the player progresses, the 
resolution of the images are lower and lower.

This game was done as an AI research about the feasibility of using reverse AI
(The computer directs the efforts of humans to do typical AI tasks, so you
can call it Artificial Artificial Intelligence) in the task of feature extraction.
The idea was that to exctract thouse features in the images wich were consistently
recognized by humans even as the image was shown with lower resolution.
